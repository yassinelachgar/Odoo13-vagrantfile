Vagrantfile for Odoo 13
---

This Vagrantfile creates a virtual machine with everything set up for Odoo 13.
Odoo is downloaded from the [official Github repository](https://github.com/odoo/odoo).

A bash script is available to run Odoo.
It will also add any addon available on the shared folder `/vagrant_data`.
This may be useful when developing an addon.
